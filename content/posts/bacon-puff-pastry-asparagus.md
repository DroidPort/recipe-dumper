## Ingredients

- 1 packet puff pastry, defrosted
- 12 spears asparagus, ends snapped
- 6 slices thick-cut bacon, halved lengthwise
- 1 egg, beaten (for egg wash)
- Black pepper, to taste
- 1 tbsp spicy mustard
- 1 tsp chili sauce (e.g., sriracha)

## Instructions

1. **Prepare the puff pastry:** Defrost the puff pastry and slice it into thin strips, like "spaghetti".
2. **Prep the asparagus:** Snap the woody ends off each asparagus spear.
3. **Wrap with pastry:** Spiral-wrap a strip of puff pastry around each asparagus spear.
4. **Prep the bacon:** Slice each thick-cut bacon strip lengthwise to make thinner strips.
5. **Wrap with bacon:** Wrap a bacon strip over the puff pastry-covered asparagus, again in a spiral.
6. **Prepare to bake:** Line a baking tray with parchment paper. Place the wrapped asparagus spears on the tray.
7. **Season and egg wash:** Brush with egg wash and sprinkle with black pepper.
8. **Bake:** Bake at 375째F (190째C) for 20 minutes, or until golden and crisp.
9. **Make the dipping sauce:** Mix spicy mustard and chili sauce together in a small bowl.
10. **Serve:** Serve hot with the spicy mustard sauce on the side.

## Notes

Perfect as a Thanksgiving or holiday appetizer. The bacon adds saltiness, so additional salt isn't necessary.
