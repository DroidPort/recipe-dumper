## Ingredients

- 1 cup nonsense
- 2 tbsp placeholder sauce
- 3 slices of mock bacon
- 4 units of structured data
- A dash of lorem ipsum
- 1 egg (for stability)

## Instructions

1. **Preheat** your logic engine to 420° (nice).
2. **Combine** nonsense and structured data in a large imaginary bowl.
3. **Wrap** the mixture lovingly in mock bacon and gently baste with placeholder sauce.
4. **Apply** egg wash to give it a glossy sheen of legitimacy.
5. **Bake** in your mind for 15–20 ticks of the imaginary clock.
6. **Serve** hot, preferably on a bed of JSON.

## Notes

- Totally inedible.
- Useful for markdown rendering and testing automation pipelines.
- Replace "testicles" with something less disturbing in prod.
